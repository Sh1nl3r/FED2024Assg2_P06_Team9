MokeSell is an online website allowing users to buy, view and sell second-hand items. The project aims to have basic and advanced features using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Json to integrate these features onto our website. 

The website aims to incorporate what we had previously learned in class to utilise RestDB to our advantage to store and retrieve data rather than keeping it on our local storage. The usage of API allowed us to implement different features we has set out to do such as account management, listing management, and various other features to make our website as interactive as possible. 

The website also aimed to be simple to use and easy to understand in order to be more user friendly. The navigaton bar, search bar and support and feedback forms allows users to move around the site easily without too much difficulty with understanding which page links to what and how to access certain pages.

## Design Process

The website uses a light colored theme throughout its listings in the form of grey, backgrounds in the form of white and the navigation bar which stands out in the form of black. Furthermore, the colors are easy on the eye and consistent throughout the different pages. For example, listings, whether they are on the index page or listing page, will always be made in a way where the listing cards will look the same and are of similar dimensions and colors. The consistency in the different elements on the pages through the use of our CSS files allows for them to be easily recognisable and easily editable if any changes are needed. The design is also created in a way that supports both mobile and desktop view.

### Unsupported Features
While we had high aspiratons to add in more fearures to our site, we were limited by the use of RestDB since it was the free version and despite our best efforts there were some features that are available in website but not fully working.
 - Despite using AI, we were unable to upload photos and retrieve them from our database, we had also chosen not to store them in our local devices in the images folder since that would be hardcoding and primarily since our listings details only came from our RestDB database.
 - When clicking on Edit Profile in the profile page. The external page will fetch the user's profile details, however there is an unsolved error when clicking on the save changes button to update the user's details.
 - Our chat function is only a one way system since we were unable to find out how to create a chat between one user and another by creating a field that links to a collection in RestDB.
 - While the review collection saves the review and star rating, we failed to find a way to link it to the sellers account to display the number of reviews under their account as well as the average rating of the seller.
 - While bump is able to edit the listing details in the form of an integer, we did not manage to find a way to link it to the carousel by only displaying listings that were in the top 5 in terms of the bump integer number.

## Technologies Used

HTML: Gave the webpage its sturcture which had held the main content of the webpage such as classes and forms and divisions and also where the CSS and JavaScript files were referenced.
CSS: Used to give the website life through the use of colors and formatting and styling which allowed the website to be interactive and more appealing.
JavaScript: Played a massive role in bringing the website to life as it allowed us to connect to our RestDB which enabled us to fetch and put and create objects in our database such as lisitings and accounts. Furthermore, it allowed for our website to be more interactive between the user and also change the details of the website based on the user's actions (create lisiting, edit listing, profile info).

## Assistive AI
Part of the project was possible due to the usage of open source AI, namely ChatGpt. The usage of AI allowed us to learn and understand how the fetching and creation of objects such as accounts or feedback or listings work and also helped us to create certain features such as carousel and spin the wheel (gamification feature) to allow our website to be more interactive with the user.
